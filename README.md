Cloudbite helps you retain knowledge with flashcards and spaced repetition. A detailed explanation about the learning methodology is available on the site (click the "i" link at the top). The flashcard set in this repository is geared for cloud certificate exams, but you could replace the deck of flashcards with any subject you like. Cloudbite is not mobile-responsive, but should be usable with most devices.
